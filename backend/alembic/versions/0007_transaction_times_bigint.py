"""transactions.performTime and cancelTime hold milliseconds, which int4 cannot

Both columns were declared Integer — 32-bit, maximum 2,147,483,647. Every
writer of them stores `int(time.time() * 1000)`, which today is about
1,788,000,000,000. On PostgreSQL that insert raises NumericValueOutOfRange and
rolls back the transaction it is part of.

The transaction it is part of is the one that credits a balance after a
successful payment. So the Uzum e-commerce webhook could not complete a top-up
at all: the bank took the money, the commit failed, and nothing was recorded.
It went unnoticed because the only tests on that endpoint cover its rejection
paths — bad signature, wrong amount, not configured — and none of those reach
the line.
