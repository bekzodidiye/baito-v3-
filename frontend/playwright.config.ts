/* 5173 is vite's default, so it is also the port a developer's `npm run dev`
   takes - and the CI runner is that same laptop. A dev server started between
   two runs is enough to fail the suite outright:

     Error: http://localhost:5173 is already used, make sure that nothing is
     running on the port/url or set reuseExistingServer:true in config.webServer

   which is exactly what happened to 5bdb5a7 on main, nine minutes after the
   same suite passed on the pull request.

   reuseExistingServer stays false under CI on purpose: testing against
   whatever happens to be listening is worse than failing. So CI is handed a
   port of its own instead, the same way the postgres and redis services are
   already shifted off their defaults. Locally the default stays 5173, where
   reusing a dev server that is already up is the point. */
